<h3>INEDITED LETTER FROM THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY,
AUTHOR OF THE "CHARACTERISTICS," TO
LE CLERC, RESPECTING LOCKE.</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We are indebted to our valued correspondent <span class="sc">Janus
  Dousa</span>, for a transcript of the following important
  letter&mdash;the original of which is preserved in the Remonstrant
  Library of Amsterdam&mdash;and for which our correspondent acknowledges
  his obligations to the great kindness of Prof. des Amories van der
  Hoven.]</p>

</div>

  <p class="author">"St. Giles's, in Dorset, Feb. 8-13. 1705.

  <p>"Sir,&mdash;Having once writt to you in my own Language, I continue to
  use the same Privilege. I am sorry that I am in no better a condition to
  acquit my self of my Promise to you. My Recovery has been so slow, that I
  am scarce yet got up: and I have been unable to hold any Correspondance
  with my Friends in Town. Mr. King promisd to send me the Papers I
  mention'd to you of Mr. Lock's; who, it seems, had begun some Memoires of
  his own relating to my G<sup>d</sup> Father. These however imperfect, yet
  as being Mr. Lock's own I should have been glad to send you with what
  supplement I could make myself: But Mr. King's Engagements in the Publick
  affaires has made him delay this so long, that according to the account
  you have given me of the shortness of your Time, I must wayt no longer:
  but content my self with giving you what I can out of my own head,
  without other Assistance.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lock came into my Grandfathers Family in the summer of the year
  1666, recommended by his Friend<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Mr. Bennet of y<sup>e</sup> town of
  Shaftesbury. The occasion of it was thus. My Grandfather had been ill for
  a great while after a Fall, by w<sup>ch</sup> his Breast was so bruised
  that in time it came to an Imposthumation (?) within, and appeard by a
  swelling under his stomach. Mr. Lock was at that time a student in
  Physick at Oxford: and my Grandfather taking a journey that way to drink
  the Waters (having Mr. Bennett in y<sup>e</sup> Coach with him), He had
  this young Physician presented to him: who tho' he had never practic'd
  Physick; yet appear'd to my Grandfather to be such a Genius that he
  valew'd him above all his other Physicians, the great men in practice of
  those times. Accordingly on his advice and allmost solely by his
  Direction my G<sup>d</sup> Father underwent an Operation w<sup>ch</sup>
  sav'd his Life, and was the most wonderfull of the kind that had been
  heard of, till that time. His Breast was layd open, the matter
  discharg'd, and an Orifice ever afterwards kept open by a silver pipe: an
  Instrument famouse <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>upon Record, in the Writings our Popish and
  Jacobite Authors, who never faild to reproach him with this
  Infirmity.</p>

  <p>"After this Cure, Mr. Lock grew so much in esteem with my Grand-Father
  that as great a Man as he had experienc'd him in Physick; he look'd upon
  this but as his least part. He encourag'd him to turn his Thoughts
  another way. Nor would he suffer him to practice Physick except in his
  own Family and as a kindness to some particular Friend. He put him upon
  the studdy of the Religiouse and Civil affaires of the Nation with
  whatsoever related to the Business of a Minister of State: in
  w<sup>ch</sup> he was so successfull, that my G<sup>d</sup> Father begun
  soon to use him as a Friend, and consult with him on all occasions of
  that kind. He was not only with him in his Library and Closet, but in
  company with the Great Men of those times, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord
  Hallifax and others, who being men of Witt and Learning, were as much
  taken with him. For together with his seriouse, respectfull and humble
  Character, he had a mixture of Pleasantry and a becoming Boldness of
  Speech. The Liberty he could take with these great Men was peculiar to
  such a Genius as his. A pleasant Instance of it runs in my Mind: tho'
  perhaps the relation of it may not be so pleasing to another.</p>

  <p>"At an appointed Meeting of two or three of these Great-Men at my
  G<sup>d</sup> Father's House, more for Entertainment and good company
  than for Business, it happen'd that after a few Compliments the Cards
  were called for, and the Court-Fashion prevailing, they were engag'd in
  Play before any Conversation was begun. Mr. Lock sate by as a spectator
  for some time. At least taking out his Table-Book, he began to write
  something very busily: till being observd by one of the Lords, and ask'd
  what he was meditating; My Lords (sayd he) I am improving my self the
  best I can in your Company: for, having impatiently wayted this Honour of
  being present at such a meeting of the wisest Men and greatest Witts of
  the Age, I thought I could not do better than to write your Conversation:
  and here I have it, in substance, all that has pass'd for this hour or
  two. There was no need of Mr. Lock's writing much of the Dialogue. The
  great men felt the ridicule, and took pleasure in improving it. They
  quitted their Play, and fell into a Conversation becoming them: and so
  passed the remainder of the Day.</p>

  <p>"When my G<sup>d</sup> Father, from being Chancellor of the Exchequer,
  was made High Chancellor (w<sup>ch</sup> was in the year 1672) he
  advanc'd Mr. Lock to the Place of Secretary for the Clergy: and when my
  G<sup>d</sup> Father quitted the Court and began to be in Danger from it,
  Mr. Lock now shard with him in Dangers, as before in Honours &amp;
  Advantages. He entrusted him with his secretest negotiations, and made
  use of his assistant Pen in matters that nearly concerned the State, and
  were fitt to be made publick, to raise that spirit in the Nation which
  was necessary against the prevailing Popish Party.</p>

  <p>"It was for something of this kind that got air, and out of great
  Tenderness to Mr. Lock that my Grandfather in the year 1674 sent him
  abroad to travell: an Improvement w<sup>ch</sup> my G<sup>d</sup> father
  was gladd to add to those he had allready given him. His Health servd as
  a very just Excuse: he being consumptive as early in his Life as that
  was. So that having travelld thro' France he went<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> to Montpelier and there stayd for
  some time. He returnd again to my G<sup>d</sup> Fathers in the year 1678,
  and remaind in his Family till the year 1682: w<sup>ch</sup> was the year
  that my G<sup>d</sup> Father retird into Holland and there dyed. Mr. Lock
  who was to have soon followd him thither, was not prevented in the
  voyage, by this Death: but found it safest for him to retire thither, and
  there lived (at our good Friend Mr. Furly's of Rotterdam) till the happy
  Revolution of King William, w<sup>ch</sup> restord him to his native
  Country and to other Publick offices of greater Note, w<sup>ch</sup> by
  fresh Meritts he deserv'd: witness his then Publishd Books of Government,
  Trade and Coin: by w<sup>ch</sup> he had as considerably servd the State,
  as he had done the Church and Protestant Interest by his defence of
  Toleration and support of the Revolution-Principles.</p>

  <p>"But of this part of his Life, you need no Information.</p>

  <p>"Thus far I have made mention of Mr. Lock as to his station in Publick
  affaires, under my Grandfather. Now as to his Service in private
  affaires, and the Concerns of a Family, w<sup>ch</sup> was, in every
  respect, so happy in him, that he seem as a good Guardian Angel sent to
  bless it.</p>

  <p>"When Mr. Lock first came into the Family, my Father was a youth of
  about fifteen or sixteen. Him my Grandfather entrusted wholly to Mr. Lock
  for what remain'd of his Education. He was an only Child, and of no firm
  Health: w<sup>ch</sup> induc'd my G<sup>d</sup> Father, in concern for
  his Family to think of marrying him as soon as possible. He was too young
  and unexperienc'd to chuse a Wife for himself: and my Grandfather too
  much in Business to chuse one for him. The affair was nice, for tho' my
  Grandfather requir'd not a great Fortune, he insisted on good Blood, good
  Person and Constitution, and above all, good Education, and a Character
  as remote as possible from that of Court- or Town-bred Lady. All this was
  thrown upon Mr. Lock, who being allready so good Judge of Men, my Grand
  Father doubted not of his equal <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>Judgment in Women. He departed from him,
  entrusted and sworn, as <i>Abraham's</i> Head-servant<a
  name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> <i>that ruled
  over all that he had</i>, and went into a far-Country (the North of
  England) <i>to seek for his Son a Wife</i> whome he as successfully
  found. Of Her, I and six more of us, Brothers &amp; Sisters, were born;
  in whose Education Mr. Lock govern'd according to his own Principles
  (since publishd by him) and with such success that we all of us came to
  full years, with strong healthy Constitutions: my own the worst; tho'
  never faulty till of late. I was his more peculiar Charge: being as
  eldest son, taken by my Grandfather, &amp; bred under his immediate Care:
  Mr. Lock having the absolute Direction of my Education, and to whome next
  my immediate Parents as I must own the greatest Obligation, so I have
  ever preserved the highest Gratitude &amp; Duty.</p>

  <p>"I could wish that my Time and Health would permit me to be longer in
  this Account of my Friend and Foster-Father, Mr. Lock. If I add any thing
  as you desire, concerning my Grandfather himself, it must have a second
  place: this being a subject more selfish and in w<sup>ch</sup> I may
  justly suspect my self of Partiality: of w<sup>ch</sup> I would willingly
  be free: and think I truly am so in this I now send you. But I fear least
  this (such as it is) should come too late, and therefore hasten to
  conclude with repeated Assurances of my being your Oblig'd Friend and
  humble Servant</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">"Shaftesbury</span>.

  <p>"P.S. If after what I have said I dare venture a Word to you as to my
  Grandfather's Apology for the one and only thing I repine at in his whole
  Life (I mean the unhappy Words you mention <i>delenda est Carthago</i>),
  It must be this: That the Publick would not insist on this as so ill, and
  injuriouse; if they considered the English Constitution and manner of
  those times in w<sup>ch</sup> the Prince more lofty in Prorogative and at
  greater distance from his People than now of days, used but a few Words
  to his Parlement; and committed the rest to his Keepers or Chancellor, to
  speak his sence for him (as he expresses it in y<sup>e</sup> conclusion
  of his own speech) upon w<sup>ch</sup> my Grandfather, the then
  Chancellor, and in his Chancellor's Place<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, spoke of King's sence, as the
  King's mouth; in y<sup>e</sup> same manner as the Speaker of the House of
  Peers or Commons, speaks the House's sence, as <i>the House's mouth</i>
  (for so he is esteemd and calld) whatsoever may be his own private sence;
  or tho' he may have deliver'd his own Opinion far contrary.</p>

  <p>"Such was my Grandfather's Call: who was far from delivering his Vote
  or Opinion in this manner, either as a Councillor or Peer, or in his
  Place in Parlement: where he carryed on a direct opposite Interest: he
  being allready in open Enmity with the Duke of York and his Party that
  carryed on that Warr, in so much that he was at that very time suspected
  of holding a Correspondence with Holland in favour of the
  Commonwealth-Party in England. However it be, it is no small Comfort to
  me that that wise Commonwealth of Holland, the Parent and Nursing-Mother
  of Liberty, thought him worthy of their Protection when he was a sufferer
  for the common Cause of Religion and Liberty: and he must ever remain a
  noble Instance of the Generosity of that State, and of that potent Head
  of it, y<sup>e</sup> City of Amsterdam; where yourself and other Great
  Men have met with a Reception y<sup>t</sup> will redound to their
  Honour.</p>

  <p>"My Grandfather's <i>turning short upon the Court</i> (as<a
  name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Sir William
  Temple expresses it) had only this plain reason for it; that he discoverd
  the King to be a Papist, through that disguise of an <i>Esprit fort</i>,
  w<sup>ch</sup> was a character his Vices and over fondness of Witt made
  him affect and act very naturally. Whatever Complyances my Grandfather,
  as a States-man, might make before this discovery, to gain the King, from

<h3>MR. GOUGH'S TRANSLATION OF THE HISTORY OF
THE BIBLE.</h3>

  <p>In vol. vi., p. 266., of Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, "Memoirs
  of Mr. Gough," is the following anecdote of Mr. Gough's precocious
  talents&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At the very early age of eleven he commenced a task that would have
  reflected credit on any period of life; which, by the indulgence of his
  mother, appeared in print under the title of '<i>The History of the
  Bible</i>, translated from the French by R.&nbsp;G., junior, 1746. London:
  Printed by James Waugh in the year 1747.' Of this curious volume,
  consisting of 160 sheets in folio, not more than twenty-five copies were
  printed, as presents to a few particular friends and when completed at
  the press, it is marked by way of colophon, 'Done at twelve years and a
  half old.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Nichols in his notes says, that the French edition was printed at
  Amsterdam, in 2 vols. folio, with plates, 1700. That by the generosity of
  Mr. Gough's worthy relict, he had a copy of the work with Mr. Gough's
  corrections in maturer age; and in a note at p. 642. of this volume of
  the <i>Literary Anecdotes</i> Mr. Nichols further states, that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"By a singular chance, at a sale of the library of Dr. Guise in
  January, 1812, he met with two copies of Mr. Gough's juvenile translation
  of the <i>History of the Bible</i>; and at the end of one of the volumes
  were ten sheets of Mr. Pickering's <i>Dictionary</i>, perhaps the only
  copy of them in existence."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Rev. Roger Pickering was Mr. Gough's tutor until he was admitted
  at Bene't College, Cambridge, July, 1752, being then in the 17th year of
  his age. This Dictionary was compiled on the plan of Calmet, but left
  unfinished.</p>

  <p>Mr. J. B. Nichols, son of the late venerable octogenarian, having
  recently presented me with a copy of Mr. Gough's scarce volume, I am
  anxious to learn by whom the original French work was written, and where
  a copy may be purchased. It is one of much erudition; sound in doctrine
  and principle; pleasing and familiar in its language, and would, I should
  think, well repay the publisher of a new edition, after a careful
  correction of a few deficiencies in composition, incidental to the early
  period at which Mr. Gough translated it. There is nothing in the preface,
  or in any part of the volume, to indicate the name of the original
  author. Should Mr. J.&nbsp;B. Nichols still possess Mr. Gough's more matured
  and corrected copy, he might perhaps discover some reference to the
  author.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Lammer Beads</i> (Vol. iii. p. 84.).&mdash;If L. M. M. R. had taken
  the trouble to consult Jamieson's <i>Etymological
  Dictionary</i>,&mdash;that rich storehouse of curious information, not
  merely in relation to the language, but to the manners and customs, and
  the superstitions of North Britain,&mdash;he would have found interesting
  notices connected with his inquiry. See the word <span
  class="sc">Lammer</span>, and the same in the Supplement. We might
  accept, without a moment's hesitation, the suggestion of a learned friend
  of Dr. Jamieson's, deriving Lammer from the French, <i>l'ambre</i>, were
  it not that Kilian gives us Teut. Lamertyn-steen, <i>succinum</i>. In
  Anglo-Saxon times it was called Eolhsand (<i>Gloss. Ælfr.</i>), and
  appears to have been esteemed in Britain from a very early period.
  Amongst antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon age, beads of amber are of very
  frequent occurrence. Douglas has collected some interesting notes
  regarding this substance, in his <i>Nenia</i>, p. 9. It were needless to
  cite the frequent mention of <i>precularia</i>, or Paternosters, of
  amber, occurring in inventories. The Duke of Bedford, Regent of France,
  purchased a most costly chaplet from a Parisian jeweller, in 1431,
  described as "une patenostres à signeaux d'or et d'ambre musquet."
  (Leber, Inventaires, p. 235.) The description "de alba awmbre," as in the
  enumeration of strings of beads appended to the shrine of S<sup>r</sup>
  William, at York Minster, may have been in distinction from jet, to
  which, as well as to amber, certain virtuous or talismanic properties
  were attributed. There were, however, several kinds of
  amber,&mdash;<i>succinum rubrum</i>, <i>fulvum</i>, &amp;c. The learned
  professor of Copenhagen, Olaus Worm, alludes to the popular notions and
  superstitious use of amber&mdash;</p>

  terriculamenta pueros tueri volunt; capitis etiam destillationibus, et

  <p>By his account it would seem to have been received as a panacea,
  sovereign for asthma, dropsy, toothache, and a multitude of diseases.</p>

  <p>"In summâ (he concludes) Balsami instar est, calorem nativum roborans

</blockquote>

  <p>Bartholomaeus Glanvilla, in his work, <i>De Proprietatibus Rerum</i>,
  has not overlooked the properties of amber, which he seems to regard as a
  kind of jet (book xvi., c. xlix.).</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Gette, hyght Gagates, and is a boystous stone, and never the les it

<h3>ON CATALOGUES OF BOOKS.</h3>

  <p>A series of notes on the <i>utility</i> of printed catalogues of
  public libraries may seem to be a superfluity. It may be said, <i>Who
  ever denied it?</i> Relying on a official document, I can assert that it
  <i>has</i> been denied&mdash;in defiance of common sense, and the
  experience of two hundred and fifty years!</p>

  <p>At such a time, it behoves every lover of literature to declare
  himself, and to furnish his quota of facts or arguments corrective of
  this upstart paradox. It is under the influence of that sentiment that I
  submit, for consideration in the proper quarter, some short extracts from
  my bibliographic portfolios.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Bolton Corney.</span>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The forwardness of your <span class="scac">CATALOGUE</span> [of the
  public library at Oxford] is very good tidings.... I would intreat you to
  meditate upon it, how it may be performed to both our credits and
  contents."&mdash;<i>Sir Thomas</i> <span class="sc">Bodley</span> to
  <i>Tho. James</i>, c. 1604.</p>

  class="sc">Hyde</span>, 1674.</p>

  <p>"The general use of catalogues of [of books], and the esteem they are

  on it."&mdash;<i>Gerard</i> <span class="sc">Langbaine</span>, 1688.</p>

  <p>"Quelles obligations la république des lettres n'a-t-elle pas aux

  donné."&mdash;<span class="sc">Jourdan</span>, 1739.</p>

  <p>Catalogues of books are of great use in literary pursuits.... We mean

  1837.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The "Winter's Tale."</i>&mdash;As <span class="sc">Mr. Payne
  Collier</span> is making inquiries as to the origin of Shakspeare's
  <i>Winter's Tale</i>, perhaps he will allow me to call his attention to
  an oversight he has committed in his edition of Greene's <i>Pandosto</i>,
  in the series called <i>Shakspeare's Library</i>. In a note to the
  introduction, p. ii., <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> says,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Some verbal resemblances and trifling obligations have been pointed
  out by the commentators in their notes to the <span class="sc">Winter's
  Tale</span>. One of the principal instances occurs in Act IV. Sc. 3.,
  where Florizel says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"'The gods themselves,</p>
      <p>Humbling their deities to love, have taken</p>
      <p>The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter</p>
      <p>Became a bull and bellow'd; the green Neptune</p>
      <p>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,</p>
      <p>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,</p>
      <p>As I seem now. Their transformations</p>
      <p>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,</p>
      <p>Nor in a way so chaste.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"'This,' says Malone, 'is taken almost literally from the
  novel'&mdash;when, in fact, the resemblance merely consists in the
  adoption by Shakspeare of part of the mythological knowledge supplied by
  Greene. 'The gods above disdaine not to love women beneath. Ph&oelig;bus
  liked Daphne; Jupiter Io; and why not I then Fawnia?' The resemblance is
  anything but literal."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would appear, however, that the passage cited by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> is not the one referred to by Malone. <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span>'s passage is at p. 34. of his edition of
  the novel; the one Malone evidently had in view is at p. 40., and is as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And yet, Dorastus, shame not at thy shepheard's weede: the heavenly
  godes have sometime earthly thoughtes. Neptune became a ram, Jupiter a
  bul, Apollo a shepheard: they Gods, and yet in love; and thou a man,
  appointed to love."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">E. L. N.

  <p><i>Inscribed Alms-dish.</i>&mdash;There is an alms-dish (?) <!-- Page
  102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>in the
  possession of a clergyman near Rotherham, in this county, with the
  following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">"VREEST . GODT . ONDERHOVEDT . SYN . GEBOEDT . ANNO . 1634."</span></p>

<p class="cenhead">[Fear God (and?) keep his commandments.]</p>

  <p>Having so lately been so justly reproved by your correspondent, <span
  class="sc">Mr. Janus Dousa</span>, for judging of Vondel's <i>Lucifer</i>
  by an apparently unjust review rather than by perusal,&mdash;and his
  beautiful chorus having so fully "established his case,"&mdash;I am
  rather shy of making any remarks upon this inscription: otherwise I would
  venture (errors excepted) to observe that there <i>may</i> be a mistake
  in the position of the last three letters of the third word.</p>

  <p>If <span class="sc">Mr. Dousa</span> would kindly inform a <i>very</i>
  imperfect Dutch scholar whether this sentence is intended as a quotation
  from Ecclesiastes xii., 13th verse,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Vreest Godt ende hout sÿne geboden;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>or whether the third word is from the verb "<i>onder
  houden</i>,"&mdash;as <i>looks</i> probable, I shall be greatly obliged
  to him. The Bible to which I refer is dated 1644.</p>

  <p>Being neither a scholar nor a critic, but only a lover of books and
  languages, I hope <span class="sc">Mr. Dousa</span> will accept my
  apology for the affront offered to his countryman, Vondel. Your
  publication has been a great temptation to people with a few curious
  books around them to set sail their little boats of inquiry or
  observation for the mere pleasure of seeing them float down the stream in
  company with others of more importance and interest. I confess myself to
  have been one of the injudicious number; and having made shipwreck of my
  credit against M. Brellet's <i>Dictionnaire de la Langue Celtique</i>,
  and also on Vondel's <i>Lucifer</i>, I must here apologise and promise to
  offend no more. If <span class="sc">Mr. Dousa</span> will not be
  appeased, I have only to add that I "send him my card." As Mrs. Malaprop
  said to Sir Lucius O'Trigger&mdash;</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Spare my blushes&mdash;<i>I</i> am Delia."</p>

  <p>P. S. Can <span class="sc">Mr. Dousa</span> fix a positive date to my
  undated <i>History of Dr. John Faustus</i>?</p>

  <p><i>Landwade Church.</i>&mdash;It appears to me that an important
  service would be rendered to posterity, if a full account were taken of
  all the monuments and inscriptions in such deserted churches as Landwade
  appears to be. Such records may ere long become invaluable, and every day
  is hastening them to oblivion. Already hundreds of such churches, with
  the several monuments and inscriptions they contained, have entirely
  passed away. I have been making some investigation into the demolished
  and desecrated churches of Buckinghamshire, and am astonished at the
  number of monumental records which have thus perished. Thirty-one
  churches at least have been lost to the county, and some of them were
  rich in monumental memorials.</p>

  <p>Other counties, doubtless, have equally suffered. Would it not,
  therefore, be well to collect accounts of the memorials they contained,
  so far as they can be obtained, and have them recorded in some
  publication, that they may be available to future historians,
  genealogists, and antiquaries? Is there any existing periodical suitable
  for the purpose?</p>

  <p><i>The First Edition of the Second Book of Homilies, by Queen
  Elizabeth in</i> 1563.&mdash;In the edition of the <i>Homilies</i> at the
  Oxford University press in 1822, and which from inspection, in the
  portion concerned, appear to be the same in the last, I find in the
  Advertisement, page iv. note d., that there exist <i>four editions</i> of
  the date 1563. Of these, I presume, are two in my possession, and I
  conclude one of them to be the <i>first edition</i> on the following
  grounds:&mdash;<i>That</i> one, printed by Richard Jugge and John Cawood,
  1563, has in the last page and a half, "Faultes escaped in the printyng,"
  which appear to have been <i>corrected</i> in all the subsequent
  editions, and are as they stand in the subsequent and modern editions, I
  presume, up to the present time. But the principal proof arises from a
  cancelled leaf in the Homily, "Of Common Prayer and Sacraments," as it
  stands in the Oxford edition of 1822, p. 329-331. The passage in
  question, as it there stands, and stands likewise in another edition of
  1563, which I have, begins within three lines of the end of the
  paragraph, p. 329.,&mdash;"eth, that common or public prayer," &amp;c.,
  and ends at p. 331. line 13.,&mdash;"ment of baptism and the Lord's
  supper," &amp;c. In my presumed first edition the original passage has
  been dismissed, and the substituted passage, being one leaf, <i>in a
  smaller type</i>, in order plainly to contain more matter, and it is that
  which appears, as I suppose, in all subsequent and the present copies. It
  would have been a matter of some curiosity, and perhaps of some
  importance, to have the original cancelled passage. But every intelligent
  reader will perceive that the subject was one which required both
  delicacy and judgment. Is any copy existing which has the original
  passage? My copy unfortunately is imperfect, wanting three leaves; and I
  apprehend this is an additional instance in which the first edition of an
  important work has been in a manner thrown aside for its imperfection; as
  was the case with the real first edition of the <i>Canons and Decrees of
  the Council of Trent</i>, and the <i>Execution of Justice</i> given to
  Burghley. As the Oxford editor wished for information upon this subject,
  it is hoped that the present communication may not be unacceptable to
  him.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>DUTCH TRANSLATION OF A TRACT BY ROBERT
GREENE.</h3>

  <p>I was thinking of sending you a note or two on an early Dutch
  translation of a very celebrated English tract when your last number came
  to hand, by which I find that so much interest has been produced by
  "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" in Holland, that certain
  <i>literati</i> are about to establish a similar work in that country. If
  I mistake not, what I now transmit will be acceptable to your Batavian
  friends, and not unwelcome to those who approve of your undertaking on
  this side of the water.</p>

  <p>A good deal has been advanced lately regarding the interest taken by
  the inhabitants of Holland, Belgium, and Germany, in our ancient drama;
  and in consistency with what was said by Thomas Heywood more than 200
  years ago, some new information has been supplied respecting the
  encouragement given to English players abroad. The fact itself was
  well-known, and the author last cited (Shakspeare Society's reprint of
  the <i>Apology for Actors</i>, 1841, p. 58.) furnishes the name of the
  very play performed on one occasion at Amsterdam. The popularity of our
  drama there perhaps contributed to the popularity of our lighter
  literature, (especially of such as came from the pens of our most
  notorious playwrights,) in the same part of Europe, and may account for
  the circumstance I am about to mention.</p>

  <p>At this time of day I need hardly allude to the reputation the
  celebrated Robert Greene obtained in England, both as a dramatist and a
  pamphleteer; and although we have no distinct evidence on the point, we
  need hardly doubt that some of his plays had been represented with
  applause in Holland. <i>The Four Sons of Aymon</i>, which Heywood tells
  us was acted with such strange effect at Amsterdam, must have been a
  piece of precisely the same kind as Greene's <i>Orlando Furioso</i>,
  which we know was extraordinarily popular in this kingdom, and may have
  been equally so abroad. We may thus suppose that Greene's fame had spread
  to the Netherlands, and that anything written by him would be well
  received by Batavian readers.</p>

  <p>His <i>Quip for an Upstart Courtier, or, a Quaint Dispute between
  Velvet-breeches and Cloth-breeches</i>, was published in London in 1592,
  and went through two, if not three, impressions in its first year. It was
  often reprinted, and editions in 1606, 1615, 1620, 1625, and 1635, have
  come down to us, besides others that, no doubt, have entirely
  disappeared. That the fame of this production extended to Holland, I have
  the proof before me: it is a copy of the tract in Dutch, with the
  following imprint&mdash;"<i>Tot Leyden. By Thomas Basson</i>. <span
  class="scac">M.D.CI.</span>" A friend of mine writes me from Rotterdam,
  that he has a copy, without date, but printed about twenty or
  five-and-twenty years after mine of 1601, which shows how long the
  popularity of the tract was maintained; and I have little doubt that mine
  is not by any means the earliest Dutch impression, if only because the
  wood-cut of the Courtier and the Countryman (copied with the greatest
  precision from the London impression of 1592) is much worn and blurred.
  The title-page runs as follows, and the name of Robert Greene is rendered
  obvious upon it for the sake of its attraction:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Een Seer vermakelick Proces tusschen Fluweele-Broeck ende
  Laken-Broeck. Waer in verhaldt werdt het misbruyck van de meeste deel der
  Menschen. Gheshreven int Engelsch door Robert Greene, ende nu int
  Neder-landtsch overgheset. Wederom oversien."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At the back of this title is printed a short address from the
  translator to the <i>Edele ende welghesinde Leser</i>, which states
  little more than that the original had been received from England, and
  concludes with the subsequent quatrain:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The spelling and punctuation are the same as in the original, and the

  some of your Dutch correspondents, whether the tract, in this or in any
  other edition, is of considerable rarity with them? In England I never
  saw a copy of it but that in my possession. I may add that every

<h3>THE BLACK ROOD OF SCOTLAND.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 308. 409.)</p>

  <p>I am not satisfied with what W.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;G. has written on this subject; and
  as I feel interested in it, perhaps I cannot bring out my doubts better
  than in the following Queries.</p>

  <p>1. Instead of this famous cross being destined by St. Margaret for
  Dunfermline, was it not transmitted by her as an heir-loom to her sons?
  <i>Fordun</i>, lib. v. cap. lv. "<i>Quasi munus hæreditarium transmisit
  ad filios.</i>" Hailes (<i>Annals</i>, sub anno 1093) distinguishes the
  cross which Margaret gifted to Dunfermline from the Black Rood of
  Scotland; and it is found in the possession of her son David I., in his
  last illness. He died at Carlisle, 24th May, 1153. (<i>Fordun</i>, ut
  supra.)</p>

  <p>2. Is not W. S. G. mistaken when, in speaking of this cross being
  seized by Edward I. in the Castle of Edinburgh in 1292, he says it is in
  a list of muniments, &amp;c., found "<i>in quadam cista in dormitorio S.
  Crucis.</i>" instead of in a list following, "<i>et in thesauria castri
  de Edinburgh inventa fuerunt ornamenta subscripta?</i>" (Ayloffe's
  <i>Calendars</i>, p. 827.; Robertson's <i>Index</i>, Introd. xiii.)</p>

  <p>3. When W. S. G. says that this cross was not held in the same
  superstitious reverence as the Black Stone of Scone, and that Miss
  Strickland is mistaken when she says that it was seized by King Edward,
  and restored at the peace of 1327, what does he make of the following
  authorities?&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1.) <i>Fordun</i>, lib. v, cap. xvii:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Illa sancta crux quam nigram vocant omni genti Scotorum non minus
  terribilem quam amabilem pro suæ reverentia sanctitatis."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>(2.) <i>Letters to the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Carlisle,
  occassioned by some Passages in his late Book of the Scotch Library,
  &amp;c.</i>, ascribed to the historian Rymer: London, 1702. From a
  "notable piece of Church history," appended to the second Letter, it
  appears that the Black Rood accompanied King Edward in his progresses,
  along with a famous English cross&mdash;the Cross Nigth,&mdash;and that
  he received on these two crosses the homage of several of the Scottish
  magnates. (The same thing, I have no doubt, will appear from the
  <i>F&oelig;dera</i> of the same historian, which I have it not in my
  power to refer to.)</p>

  <p>(3.) <i>Chronicon de Lanercost</i>, printed by the Maitland Club,
  Edinburgh, 1839, p. 283. Alluding to the pacification of 1327:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Reddidit etiam eis partem crucis Christi <i>quam vocant Scotti
  Blakerode</i>, et similiter unam instrumentum.... Ragman vocabatur.
  Lapidem tamen de Scone, in quo solent regis Scotiæ apud Scone in
  creatione sua collocari, Londonensis noluerunt a se demittere quoquomodo.
  Omnia autem hæc asportari fecerat de Scotia inclytus rex Edwardus filius
  Henrici, dum Scottos suæ subjiceret ditioni."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Fabian and Holinshed report the same thing.</p>

  <p>4. Is not Fordun <i>quoting</i> from Turgot and Aelred (whom he names
  Baldredus) when he speaks of "illa sancta crux <i>quam nigram</i>
  vocant?" And how does the description of the Durham cross,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Which rood and pictures were all three very richly wrought in silver,
  and were all smoked black over, being large pictures of a yard or five
  quarters long," &amp;c. &amp;c.,&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>agree with the description of the Black Rood of St. Margaret which, as
  Lord Hailes says, "was of <i>gold</i>, about the length of <i>a palm</i>;
  the figure of ebony, studded and inlaid with gold. A piece of the true
  cross was enclosed in it"?</p>

  <p>5. As to the cross "miraculously received by David I., and in honour
  of which he founded Holyrood Abbey in 1128," and which some antiquaries
  (see <i>A Brief Account of Durham Cathedral</i>; Newcastle, 1833, p. 46.)
  gravely assert was to be seen "in the south aisle of <i>the choir</i> of
  Durham Cathedral at its eastern termination, in front of a wooden screen
  richly gilt and decorated with stars and other ornaments," are not all
  agreed that the story is a mere monkish legend, invented long after
  Holyrood was founded (although, perhaps, not so recent as Lord Hailes
  supposed)? and is it not, therefore, absurd to speak of such a cross
  being taken at the battle of Durham, or to identify it with the Black
  Rood of Scotland?</p>

  <p>6. The quotation of W. S. G. from the <i>MS. Dunelm</i> is curious;
  but is there any contemporary authority for the Black Rood having been
  taken with King David at the battle of Durham? I can find none.</p>

  <p>7. Is it not, however, probable that King David lost <i>two</i>
  crosses at Durham, one a military cross, carried with his army, and taken
  from the Abbey of Holyrood; and the other the famous Black Rood found on
  his person, and made an offering to the shrine of St. Cuthbert? This
  would reconcile some apparent discrepancies.</p>

  <p>8. I find it noticed by Richardson in his <i>Table Book</i>
  (Newcastle, 1846, vol. i. p. 123.), that "there is a letter in the
  British Museum (Faustina, A 6. 47.) from the prior of Durham to the
  Bishop (then absent), giving an account of the battle of Neville's
  cross." Has this letter been printed, and where? If not so, will any of
  your correspondents have the <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span>kindness to examine it, and say if it
  gives any information as to a cross or crosses captured with the King of
  Scots?</p>

  <p><i>The "Tanthony."</i>&mdash;When the porteress at the principal
  entrance to Kimbolton Park opens the gates for the admission of a
  visitor, she rings a bell to give warning to the servants at the castle
  of his approach. This bell is popularly called the "Tanthony," in
  reference, I presume, to some legend of Saint Anthony. Will one of your

  <p><i>Musical Plagiarism.</i>&mdash;I think I remember to have heard, two
  or three years ago, of an action for damages brought against an eminent
  composer, on account of plagiarism in a musical composition; and that the
  defendant's argument was founded on the fact, that there exist very few
  really "original compositions," if originality excludes every form of
  plagiarism. And he adduced as examples the "See the conquering hero," of
  Handel; and the "Zitti Zitti," of Rossini. Can any of your readers refer
  me to the minutes of this trial; and tell me if any book has been
  published in criticism of the originality of composers?</p>

  <p><i>Sir Walter Raleigh.</i>&mdash;In speaking of the difficulty which

  each other as well as from himself, that he threw his MS. history into
  the fire. In what contemporary work is this recorded?</p>

  from the Scottish version of John Bellenden. Both these pieces are
  printed in Holinshed's <i>Chronicles</i>, 2 vols. fol. 1587. In the
  prefaces Harrison speaks of a work on <i>Chronology</i>, "which I have
  yet in hand." Has that work ever been printed? I discovered the
  manuscript of it last year, in the Diocesan Library of Derry, in Ireland;
  but did not ascertain <i>who</i> was its author (though it bears the name
  of Harrison), until a few days ago.</p>

  <p>The <i>Acharnians</i> and <i>Peace</i>, or perhaps even the

  father and to Walter Scott. Amongst other matters it states, that the
  original manuscript of that romance was submitted to Mr. Scott before it
  was published, and that he retained it a long time before he published
  his <i>Waverley Novels</i>. Mr. Strutt, jun., accuses him of taking hints
  and facts from his parent's work. He also stated that the story of the
  Illuminator in <i>Queen Hoo Hall</i> is mainly an account of the life of
  his father. The three volumes I gave to my friend and patron, Mr. John
  Broadly, whose very fine and choice library was sold by auction after his
  death, with the copy of the work referred to. I am desirous of
  ascertaining in whose possession these volumes are? I have a beautiful
  miniature portrait of Joseph Strutt.</p>

  <p><i>Cardinal's Monument</i>.&mdash;Passing into the church of St.

  on a pillar to the right, a sculpture of a cardinal's hat with the usual

  quartering alternately three lions and three fleur-de-lis. There is no
  name or date upon it. It would be interesting to know to whom it

  <p><i>Names Bacon and Fagan</i>.&mdash;The very curious and interesting
  information which has come to light in the replies to my Query about the
  origin of the patronymic <span class="sc">Bacon</span>, emboldens me to
  put another question upon the subject.</p>

  <p>I have long suspected, but have been unable to prove, that the names
  Bacon and Fagan were originally one and the same. Bacon, it appears, is a
  Saxon word, meaning "of the beech tree." Fagan, I presume, is as
  undoubtedly from the Latin "de fago," "of the beech tree."</p>

  <p>The approximation of sound in these names is sufficiently evident.
  That the letters C and G have been commonly convertible between the Latin
  and Saxon is without doubt. Query: Have B and F been at all used
  convertibly? Or can any of your readers, by any other means, strengthen
  the probability, or prove the truth, of my conjecture?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Nocab</span>.

  <p><i>Blunder</i>.&mdash;What is the origin of this word? In Woolston's
  <i>First Discourse on Miracles</i> (Lond. 1729), at p 28., I find this
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In another place he intimates what are meant by oxen and sheep, viz.,
  the literal sense of the Scriptures. And if the literal sense be
  irrational and nonsensical, the metaphor we must allow to be proper,
  inasmuch as nowadays dull and foolish and absurd stuff we call
  <i>Bulls</i>, <i>Fatlings</i>, and <i>Blunders</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This would seem to imply that in Woolston's days <i>blunder</i> was
  the name of some animal; but in no dictionary have I been able to find
  such a signification attributed to it. The Germans use the words
  <i>bock</i> and <i>pudel</i> in the same sense as our word
  <i>blunder</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Prince of Wales' Feathers.</i>&mdash;The establishment of "<span

  students of our early history, and the liberal mention of its projectors,
  to bring under the notice of their countrymen all Queries likely to be
  answered by them, is one calculated to clear up many obscure points in
  our early history. Sir H. Nicolas concludes his valuable papers on the
  Badge and Mottoes of the Prince of Wales (<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xxxi.
  p. 372.) by expressing his belief that both the former, namely, <i>the
  Feathers</i>, and the mottoes, "<i>Ich Dien</i>" and "<i>Houmout</i>,"
  were derived from the House of Hainault, possibly from the Comté of
  Ostrevant, which formed the appanage of the eldest sons of the Counts of
  that province. Perhaps I may be allowed, through your columns, to invite

  readers can inform me of the origin and descendants of the family with
  this scarce name, thus spelt, "Blowen." Are we a branch of the Blowers

  descendants of the Flanders "Boleyns," Anglicanized "Bloyen?"</p>

<h3>TOUCHSTONE'S DIAL.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 405.; vol. iii., p. 52.)</p>

  <p>How is it that Mr. Knight, who so well and so judiciously exposes the
  absurdness of attempting to measure out a poet's imaginings by
  rule-and-compass probability, should himself endeavour to embody and
  identify Touchstone's dial&mdash;an ideal image&mdash;a mere peg on which
  to hang the fool's sapient moralizing.</p>

  <p>Surely, whether it was a real moving animated pocket watch, that was
  present to the poet's mind, or a thumb ring dial, is an inquiry quite as
  bootless as the geographical existence of a sea-coast in Bohemia, or of
  lions and serpents in the forest of Ardennes.</p>

  <p>When Thaliard engages to take away the life of Pericles if he can get
  him within his "pistol's length," are we seriously to inquire whether the
  weapon was an Italian dagger or an English firearm? or are we to debate
  which of the interpretations would be the lesser anachronism?</p>

  <p>But your correspondents (Vol. ii., p. 405. and vol. iii., p. 52.)
  approve of, and confirm Mr. Knight's suggestion of a ring dial, as though
  it were so self-evident as to admit of no denial. Nevertheless, neither
  he nor they have shown any good reason for its adoption: even its
  superior antiquity over the portable time-piece is mere surmise on their
  parts, unaccompanied as yet by any direct proof. In point of fact, the
  sole argument advanced by Mr. Knight why Touchstone's dial should be a
  ring dial is, that "<i>it was not likely that the fool would have a
  pocket watch</i>." Well, but it might belong to Celia, carried away with
  the "jewels and wealth" she speaks of, and, on account of the unwieldy
  size of watches in those days, intrusted to the porterage of the
  able-bodied fool.</p>

  <p>When Touchstone said, so very wisely, "<i>It is ten o'clock</i>," he
  used a phrase which, according to Orlando in the same play, could only
  properly apply to a mechanical time-piece. Rosalind asks Orlando, "I pray
  you what is it <i>a clock?</i>" to which he replies, "You should ask me
  what time <i>o' day</i>; there's no clock in the forest." Again, when
  Jacques declares that he did laugh "an hour by his dial," do we not
  immediately recall Falstaff's similar phrase, "an hour by Shrewsbury
  clock?"</p>

  <p>If it shall be said that the word "dial" is more used in reference to
  a natural than to a mechanical indicator of time, I should point, in
  reply, to Hotspur's allusion:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tho' life did ride upon a dial's point</p>
      <p>Still ending with the arrival of an hour"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The "dial's point," so referred to, must be <i>in motion</i>, and is
  therefore the hand or <i>pointer</i> of a mechanical clock.</p>

  <p>A further confirmation that the Shakspearian "dial" was a piece of
  mechanism may be seen in Lafeu's reply to Bertram, when he exclaims,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Then my dial goes not true,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>using it as a metaphor to imply that his judgment must have been
  deceived.</p>

  <p>These are some of the considerations that would induce me to reject
  Mr. Knight's interpretation, and, <i>were it necessary to realize the
  scene between Jacques and Touchstone at all</i>, I should prefer doing so
  by imagining some old turnip-faced atrocity in clock-making presented to
  the fool's lack-lustre eye, than the nice astronomical observation
  supposed by Mr. Knight.</p>

  <p>The ring-dial, as described by him, and by your correspondents, is
  likewise described in most of the encyclopædias. It is available for the
  latitude of construction only, and was no doubt common enough a hundred
  years ago; but it is scarcely an object as yet for deposit in the British
  Museum.</p>

  <p>Leeds, Jan. 28. 1851.</p>

  <p>The Ring Dial, perhaps the most elegant in principle of all the forms
  of sun dial, has not, I think, fallen into greater disuse than have sun
  dials of other constructions. To describe, in this place, a modern ring
  dial, and the method of using it, would be useless: because it is an
  instrument which may be so readily inspected in the shops of most of the
  London opticians. Messrs. Troughton and Simms, of Fleet Street, make ring
  dials to a pattern of about six inches in diameter, costing, in a case,
  2<i>l</i>. 5<i>s</i>. They are, in truth, elegant and instructive
  astronomical toys, to say the least of them; and indicate the solar time
  to the accuracy of about two minutes, when the sun is pretty high.</p>

  <p>Formerly, ring dials were made of a larger diameter, with much costly
  graduation bestowed upon them; too heavy to be portable, and too
  expensive for the occasion. For example, at the apartments of the Royal
  Astronomical Society, at Somerset House, a ring dial, eighteen inches in
  diameter, may be seen, constructed by Abraham Sharp, contemporary and
  correspondent of Newton and Flamstead; one similar to which, hazarding a
  guess, I should say, could not be made under 100<i>l</i>. At the same
  place also may be seen, belonging to Mr. Williams, the
  assistant-secretary of the society, a very handsome oriental astrolabe,
  about four inches in diameter, richly chased with Arabic characters and
  symbols; to which instrument, as well as to modern ring dials, the ring
  dials described in "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" (Vol.
  iii., p. 52.) seem to bear relation. If I recollect right, in one of the
  tales of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, the barber goes out, leaving his
  customer half shaved, <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>to take an observation with his astrolabe,
  to ascertain if he were operating in a lucky <i>hour</i>. By his
  astrolabe, therefore, the barber could find the <i>time</i> of day;
  <i>this</i>, however, I confess I could not pretend to find with the
  astrolabe in question. Ring dials, as I am informed, are in demand to go
  out to India, where they are in use among surveyors and military men;
  and, no doubt, such instruments as the astrolabe above-mentioned, which,
  though pretty old, does not pretend to be an antique, are in use among
  the educated of the natives all over the East.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Robert Snow.</span>

  <p>I send you the particulars of two brass ring dials, seeing they are
  claiming some notice from your learned correspondents, and having
  recently bought them of a dealer in old metals.</p>

<h3>WINIFREDA.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 519. Vol. iii., p. 27.)</p>

  <p>Subjoined is a brief notice of the various printed forms in which the
  old song called "Winifreda" has, from time to time, been brought before
  the public. I am indebted for these particulars to a kind friend in the
  British Museum, but we have hitherto failed in discovering the
  author.</p>

  <p>1. The song first occurs as a translation from the ancient British
  language in D. Lewis's <i>Collection of Miscellaneous Poems</i>, 8vo.
  1726, vol. i., p. 53., pointed out by your correspondent, <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span>. (Vol. ii., p. 519.)</p>

  <p>2ndly. In Watts' <i>Musical Miscellany</i>, vol. vi., p. 198. Lond.
  1731; it is with the tune, "Eveillez vous ma belle Endormie," and is
  called "Winifreda, from the ancient language."</p>

  <p>3dly. As an engraved song entitled "Colin's Address;" the words by the
  Earl of Chesterfield, set by W. Yates, 1752. The air begins "Away,
  &amp;c."</p>

  <p>4thly. In 1755, 8vo., appeared <i>Letters concerning Taste</i>,
  anonymously, but by John Gilbert Cooper; in Letter XIV. pp. 95, 96, he
  says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was not in my power then to amuse you with any poetry of my own
  composition, I shall now take the liberty to send you, without any
  apology, an old song wrote above a hundred years ago by the happy
  bridegroom himself."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Cooper then praises the poem, and prints it at length.</p>

  <p>5thly. In 1765, Dr. Percy first published his <i>Reliques</i>, with
  the song, as copied from Lewis.</p>

  <p>6thly. We find an engraved song, entitled "Winifreda, an Address to
  Conjugal Love," translated from the ancient British language; set to
  music by Signor Giordani, 1780. The air begins, "Away, &amp;c."</p>

  <p>7thly. In Ritson's printed Songs as by Gilbert Cooper, Park's edition,
  1813, vol. i., p. 281., with a note by the editor referring to Aikin's
  <i>Vocal Biography</i>, p. 152.; and mentioning that in the <i>Edinburgh
  Review</i>, vol. xi., p. 37. "Winifreda" is attributed to the late Mr.
  Stephens, meaning George Steevens.</p>

  <p>8thly. In Campbell's <i>British Poems</i>, 1819, vol. vi., p. 93.,
  with a Life of John Gilbert Cooper, to whom Campbell attributes the
  authorship, stating that he was born in 1723, and died in 1769; he was,
  consequently, only three years old when the poem was printed, which would
  settle the question, even if his disclaimer had been merely a trick to
  deceive his friend.</p>

  <p>Lord Chesterfield's claim is hardly worth notice; his name seems to
  have been used to promote the sale of the "Engraven old Song;" and no one
  can doubt that he would gladly have avowed a production which would have
  added to his literary fame.</p>

  <p>Whether the problem will ever be solved, seems very doubtful; but I am
  disposed to think that the song belongs to a much earlier period, and
  that it should be looked for amongst the works of those poets of whom
  Izaak Walton has left us such agreeable reminiscences; and whose
  simplicity and moral tone are in keeping with those sentiments of good
  feeling to which "Winifreda" owes its principal attraction.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Braybrooke.</span>

  <p>Audley End.</p>

  <p><i>Winifreda</i> (Vol. iii., p. 27.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Lord
  Braybrooke</span> has revived a Query which I instituted above forty
  years ago (see <i>Gent.'s Magazine</i> for 1808, vol. lxxviii., Part
  <span class="scac">I.</span> p. 129.). The correspondent, C.&nbsp;K., who
  replied to my letter in the same magazine, mentioned the appearance of
  this song in Dodsley's <i>Letters on Taste</i> (3rd edition, 1757.) These
  letters, being edited by John Gilbert Cooper, doubtless led Aikin, in his
  collection of songs, and Park, in his edition of Ritson's <i>English
  Songs</i>, to ascribe it to Cooper. That writer speaks of it as an "old
  song," and with such warm praise, that we may fairly suppose it was not
  his own production. C.&nbsp;K. adds, from his own knowledge, that about the
  middle of the eighteenth century, he well remembered a Welsh clergyman
  repeating the lines with spirit and pathos, and asserting that they were
  written by a native of Wales. The name of Winifreda gives countenance to
  this; and the publication by David Lewis, in 1726, referred to by Bishop
  Percy, as that in which it first <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>appeared, also connects
  the song with the principality. An Edinburgh reviewer (vol. xi. p. 37.)
  says that it is "one of the love songs" by Stephens (meaning George
  Steevens), a strange mistake, as the poem appeared in print ten years
  before Steevens was born.</p>

  <p>I notice this error for the purpose of asking your readers whether
  many poems by this clever, witty, and mischievous writer exist, although
  not, to use the words of the reviewer, "in a substantive or collective
  form?" "The Frantic Lover," referred to in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
  and considered by his biographer as "superior to any similar production
  in the English language," and the verses on Elinor Rummin, are the only
  two poems of George Steevens which now occur to me; but two or three
  others are noticed in Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i> as his
  productions.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Did St. Paul's Clock strike Thirteen?</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  40.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Campkin</span> will find some notice of
  the popular tradition to which he refers, in the <i>Antiquarian
  Repertory</i>, originally published in 1775, and republished in 1807; but
  I doubt whether it will satisfactorily answer his inquiries.</p>

  <p class="author">I. H. M.

  <p><i>By the bye</i> (Vol. ii., p. 424.).&mdash;As no one of your
  correspondents has answered the Query of J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;N., as to the etymology
  and meaning of <i>by the bye</i> and <i>by and by</i>, I send you the
  following exposition; which I have collected from Richardson's
  <i>Dictionary</i>, and the authorities there referred to.</p>

  <p>Spelman informs us, that in Norfolk there were in his time thirteen
  villages with names ending in <i>by:</i> this <i>By</i> being a Danish
  word, signifying "villa." That a <i>bye</i>-law, Dan. <i>by-lage</i>, is
  a law <i>peculiar</i> to a villa. And thus we have the general
  application of <i>bye</i> to any thing; peculiar, private, indirect, as
  distinguished from the direct or main: as, <i>bye-ways</i>,
  <i>bye-talk</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh,
  <i>State Trials</i>, James I., 1603, are these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"You are fools; you are on the <i>bye</i>, Raleigh and I are on the
  <i>main</i>. We mean to take away the king and his cubs."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here the contradistinction is manifest. Lord Bacon and B. Jonson
  write, <i>on</i> the <i>by</i>; as if, on the way, in passing,
  indirectly:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'There is, <i>upon</i> the <i>by</i>, to be noted.'&mdash;'Those who
  have seluted poetry <i>on</i> the <i>by</i>'&mdash;such being a
  collateral, and not the main object of pursuit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This I think is clear and satisfactory.</p>

  <p><i>By and by</i> is quite a different matter. Mr. Tyrwhitt, upon the
  line in Chaucer,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These were his words <i>by and by</i>."&mdash;<i>R. R.</i> 4581.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>interprets "separately, distinctly;" and there are various other
  instances in Chaucer admitting the same interpretation:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Two yonge knightes ligging, <i>by and by</i>."&mdash;<i>Kn. T.</i>, v. 1016.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"His doughter had a bed all <i>by</i> hireselve,</p>
      <p>Right in the same chambre <i>by and by</i>."&mdash;<i>The Reves T.</i>, v. 4441.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So also in the "Floure and the Leafe," stanzas 9 and 24. The latter I
  will quote, as it is much to the purpose:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2hg3">"The semes (of the surcote) echon,</p>
      <p>As it were a maner garnishing,</p>
      <p>Was set with emerauds, <i>one and one</i>,</p>
      <p><i>By and by</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But there are more ancient usages, e.g. in R. Brunne, bearing also the
  same interpretation. "The chartre was read ilk poynt <i>bi and bi</i>:"
  William had taken the homage of barons "<i>bi</i> and <i>bi</i>." He
  assayed (<i>i.e.</i> tried) "tham (the horses) <i>bi and bi</i>."</p>

  <p>Richardson's conception is, that there is a <i>subaudition</i> in all
  these expressions; and that the meaning is, by point and by point; by
  baron and by baron; by horse and by horse: <i>one and one</i>, as Chaucer
  writes; each <i>one</i> separately, by <i>him</i> or <i>it</i>-self. And
  thus, that <i>by and by</i> may be explained, <i>by</i> one and <i>by</i>
  one; distinctly, both in space or time. Our modern usage is restricted to
  <i>time</i>, as, "I will do so <i>by and by</i>:" where <i>by and by</i>
  is equivalent to <i>anon</i>, <i>i.e.</i> in one (moment, instant,
  &amp;c.). And so&mdash;</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Good B'ye.</span>

  <p>Bloomsbury.</p>

  <p><i>Clement's Inn</i> (Vol. iii., p. 84.).&mdash;This inn was neither
  "a court of law" nor "an inn of court," but "an inn of chancery;"
  according to the distinction drawn by Sir John Fortescue, in his <i>De
  Laudibus Legum Angliæ</i>, chap. xlix., written between 1460 and
  1470.</p>

  <p>The evidence of its antiquity is traced back to an earlier date than
  1486; for, according to Dugdale (<i>Orig.</i>, p. 187.), in a <i>Record
  of Michaelmas</i>, 19 <i>Edward IV</i>., 1479, it is spoken of as then,
  and <i>diu ante</i>, an Inn "hominum Curiæ Legis temporalis, necnon
  hominum Consiliariorum ejusdem Legis."</p>

  <p>The early history of the Inns of Court and Chancery is involved in the
  greatest obscurity; and it is difficult to account for the original
  difference between the two denominations.</p>

  <p>Any facts which your correspondents may be able to communicate on this
  subject, or in reference to what were the <i>ten</i> Inns of Chancery
  existing in Fortescue's time, but not named by him, or relating to the
  history of either of the Inns, whether of Court or Chancery, will be most
  gratefully received by me, and be of important service at the present
  time, when I am preparing <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <i>The Judges of England</i>.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward Foss.</span>

  <p>Street-End House, near Canterbury.</p>

  <p><i>Words are men's daughters</i> (Vol. iii., p. 38.).&mdash;I take
  this to be a proverbial sentence. In the <i>Gnomologia</i> of Fuller we
  have "Words are for women; actions for men"&mdash;but there is a nearer
  approach to it in a letter written by Sir Thomas Bodley to his librarian
  about the year 1604. He says,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir John Parker hath promised more than you have signified: but words
  are women, and deeds are men."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was no doubt an adoption of the worthy knight, and I shall leave it
  to others to trace out the true author&mdash;hoping it may never be
  ascribed to an ancestor of</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Bolton Corney.</span>

  <p><i>Passage in St. Mark</i> (Vol. iii., p. 8.).&mdash;Irenæus is
  considered the best (if not the only) commentator among the very early
  Fathers upon those words in Mark xiii. 32. "<span title="oude ho huios?" class="grk"
  >&omicron;&#x1F50;&delta;&#x1F72; &#x1F41;
  &upsilon;&#x1F31;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;&#x37E;</span>" and though I cannot
  refer <span class="sc">Calmet</span> further than to the author's works,
  he can trust the general accuracy of the following
  translation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Our Lord himself," says he, "the Son of God, acknowledged that the
  Father only knew the day and hour of judgment, declaring expressly, that
  of that day and hour knoweth no one, neither the Son, but the Father
  only. Now, if the Son himself was not ashamed to leave the knowledge of
  that day to the Father, but plainly declared the truth; neither ought we
  to be ashamed to leave to God such questions as are too high for us. For
  if any one inquires why the Father, who communicates in all things to the
  Son, is yet by our Lord declared to know alone that day and hour, he
  cannot at present find any better, or more decent, or indeed any other
  safe answer at all, than this, that since our Lord is the only teacher of
  truth, we should learn of him, that the Father is above all; for the Son
  saith, 'He is greater than I.' The Father, therefore, is by Our Lord
  declared to be superior even in knowledge also; to this end, that we,
  while we continue in this world, may learn to acknowledge God only to
  have perfect knowledge, and leave such questions to him; and (put a stop
  to our presumption), lest curiously inquiring into the greatness of the
  Father, we run at last into so great a danger, as to ask whether even
  above God there be not another God."</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Dr. Latham seems to have adopted as his literary motto the dictum of
  the poet,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The proper study of mankind is man."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>We have recently had occasion to call the attention of our readers to
  his learned and interesting volume entitled <i>The English
  Language</i>,&mdash;a work which affords proof how deeply he has studied
  that remarkable characteristic of our race, which Goldsmith wittily
  described as being "given to man to conceal his thoughts." From the
  language to <i>The Natural History of the Varieties of Man</i>, the
  transition is an easy one. The same preliminary studies lead to a mastery
  of both divisions of this one great subject: and having so lately seen
  how successfully Dr. Latham had pursued his researches into the languages
  of the earth, we were quite prepared to find, as we have done, the same
  learning, acumen, and philosophical spirit of investigation leading to
  the same satisfactory results in this kindred, but new field of inquiry.
  In paying a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Dr. Prichard, whom
  he describes as "a physiologist among physiologists, and a scholar among
  scholars,"&mdash;and his work as one "which, by combining the historical,
  the philological, and the anatomical methods, should command the
  attention of the naturalist, as well as of the scholar,"&mdash;Dr. Latham
  has at once done justice to that distinguished man, and expressed very
  neatly the opinion which will be entertained by the great majority of his
  readers of his own acquirements, and of the merits of this his last
  contribution to our stock of knowledge.</p>

  <p><i>The Family Almanack and Educational Register for</i> 1851, with
  what its editor justly describes as "its noble list of grammar schools,"
  to a great extent the "offspring of the English Reformation in the
  sixteenth <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span>century," will be a very acceptable book
  to every parent who belongs to the middle classes of society; and who
  must feel that an endowed school, of which the masters are bound to
  produce testimonials of moral and intellectual fitness, presents the best
  security for the acquirement by his sons of a solid, well-grounded
  education.</p>
